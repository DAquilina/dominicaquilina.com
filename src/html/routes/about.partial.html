    I am a senior front-end web developer with fullstack and design proficiencies.

    But really, it's more than that. My Computer Engineering degree from the University of
    Waterloo taught me the importance of a solid base and good practice, but it's my passion
    that sets me apart. I write code with the phrase "quality matters" always in the back of my
    mind, and I build sites that follow what I'm calling the three "R"s: Responsive, Readable,
    and REALLY easy to use.

    During school, co-op allowed me to continually hone my skills in new and exciting
    environments -- from my introduction to app development and administrative tools at

    to my deep-dive into web accessibility at the

    work for companies like Togethr and

    After graduating, I was hired by

    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128200711/http://www.localline.ca/">Local Line Inc</a>.

    As the sole front-end developer at the company, I was charged with the impossible task of
    building an enterprise-level toolset for the food industry from practically nothing. When
    we started all we had was a dream and the dedication to make it a reality. Now, Local Line
    is establishing itself as a forerunner in the agtech space with a rapidly-growing
    catalogue of high-profile suppliers and purchasers who swear by what we built.

    It was there that I discovered what it meant to be a modern developer. Every day was a new
    challenge, and as I built out new features and managed an increasingly complex codebase almost
    alone my talent for solving interesting technical problems in creative and sustainable
    ways was nurtured into a robust and mature programming style that is able to adapt to
    ever-changing industry standards. I often find myself pushing the limits of the technologies
    I'm working with as I strive for new heights in performance and user experience. I have a
    keen eye for finding problems with function or flow and the drive and dedication to resolve
    them without compromising the integrity of the system.

    In 2017 the paradigm shifted again as I followed my wife to Ottawa, leaving Local Line behind
    and starting a new endeavour with

    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128200711/https://shopliftr.com/">Shopliftr</a>.

    Here I joined a small team of experienced developers with a big vision, and over the course of
    my time with the company I have continued to push myself to exceed expectations and develop an
    ever-expanding arsenal of tools of the trade, and where once I was restricted to a subset of
    front-end technologies, I now find myself rounding out a cadre of full-stack and design
    proficiencies. It was here that I also learned the true value of long-term vision when
    planning out a project or application. When our senior developer left the team, we sat down and
    collectively analyzed the codebase he had left behind when he took with him the tribal knowledge
    of how our systems functioned, and what we found was a mess cobbled together from years of a
    "get this out the door and deal with the consequences later" mindset. The remaining developers,
    myself included, spent the following years resolving mountains of technical debt as we completely
    re-wrote our model and API layers to be consistent and follow industry best practice. We also
    developed repeatable workflows for pre-development discovery, debugging, testing, and pull
    requests; instilled a culture of thorough documentation and testing procedures; and wrote quality
    standards for UI/UX (designed, maintained, and enforced by yours truly) and code (angular,
    typescript, unit tests, HTML, css, theming). All this while still releasing new revenue-generating
    features that resulted in two record years with a team of only 3-4 developers.

    When I'm not working, I'm probably showing off how big of a nerd I am. Whether it's playing

    slaying monsters in

    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128200711/https://idlemindunhinged.blogspot.ca/">creative writing</a>,

    the world of imagination has always fascinated me. I love fantasy and science fiction, and
    the amazing escape they provide from the mundane of every day life. The works of Terry
    Goodkind, J. R. R. Tolkien, R. A. Salvatore, and Isaac Asimov shaped my childhood and made
    me want to always strive for something greater than myself. It was these lofty aspirations
    that caused me to get involved with

    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128200711/https://www.sigmachi.org/">Sigma Chi</a>,

    a values-based fraternity boasting a long history of illustrious alumni and numerous
    growth opportunities in both leadership and personal development; and the Kitchener branch
    of

    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128200711/http://www.lspirg.org/research-and-action-groups/">Food Not Bombs</a>,

    a volunteer organization dedicated to bringing the community together through good foods and
    a message of non-violence and low waste. While I have left KW behind, these groups helped to
    build me into the man I am today, and I will always respect that journey.
